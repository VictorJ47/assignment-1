        Flamingos are elegant wading birds known for their vibrant pink feathers, long legs, and curved necks.
        Their striking color comes from their diet, which includes shrimp and algae rich in carotenoids. 
        Found in warm wetlands and lagoons, flamingos are highly social birds, often gathering in large flocks. 
        They are famous for their unique habit of standing on one leg, a behavior believed to help conserve body heat. 
        With their graceful movements and synchronized group displays, flamingos are a true spectacle in the animal kingdom.
