        Iguanas are large, herbivorous lizards known for their striking appearance and calm demeanor. 
        With their scaly skin, long tails, and spiky crests running down their backs, these reptiles are excellent climbers and often bask in the sun on tree branches. 
        The green iguana, one of the most common species found in zoos, is native to Central and South America, thriving in warm, tropical environments. 
        Iguanas use their sharp claws and strong tails for defense, and their keen eyesight helps them detect predators from a distance. 
        Despite their prehistoric look, iguanas are gentle creatures that play an essential role in their ecosystems by helping to disperse plant seeds.
