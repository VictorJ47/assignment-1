        Rhinoceroses, or rhinos, are massive, thick-skinned herbivores known for their powerful bodies and distinctive horns. 
        There are five species of rhinos, found in Africa and Asia, with the white rhino being the largest. 
        Despite their tough appearance, rhinos are primarily peaceful grazers, feeding on grass, leaves, and fruits. 
        Unfortunately, they face threats from habitat loss and poaching due to the demand for their horns. 
        With their prehistoric look and immense strength, rhinos are some of the most fascinating creatures in the wild.
