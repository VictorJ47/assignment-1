      Penguins are flightless seabirds known for their black-and-white plumage, which resembles a tuxedo. 
      They are excellent swimmers, using their flipper-like wings to propel themselves through the water in search of fish, squid, and krill. 
      Found mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, penguins thrive in cold climates like Antarctica, but some species live in warmer regions.
